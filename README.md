This project is a starting point for learning and implementing various authentication types using Express.js. It is intended for students and developers who want to understand authentication in Node.js web applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   - Run `npm install` to install all required packages.
2. **Start the server**
   - Run `npm start` to launch the Express server.

## Project Structure
- `index.js`: Main entry point for the Express server.
